# Result 1: *emc* is involved in LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut *via* *da*

## *emc* is required for LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut

In wild-type embryos of *Drosophila* *melanogaster*, the hindgut shows a left-right (LR) symmetric morphology until embryonic stage 12, although it curves toward the ventral side of the embryo (Fig. 1A, A') [@Campos-Ortega2015; @Hayashi2001].
At stage 13, the hindgut rotates anticlockwise 90°, which makes it LR asymmetric, as it curves to the right (Fig. 1B, B').
The direction and degree of the hindgut rotation are stereotypic in wild-type embryos, which rarely exhibit incomplete rotation, LR inverse, or non-lateral hindgut phenotypes (Fig. 2) [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006].
Therefore, the LR asymmetric morphology of the hindgut is strictly controlled genetically.

To elucidate the genetic mechanisms of LR asymmetric development in *Drosophila*, our group performed a genetic screen to find mutants showing LR asymmetry defects of the embryonic gut [@Hozumi2006; @Kuroda2012; @Maeda2007; @Nakamura2013; @Okumura2015; @Taniguchi2007; @Taniguchi2011].
From this screen, a novel allele of *emc*, *emc^tink^* was identified.
Tink was named after a character who has LR inverse internal organs in a Japanese animated series, Black Jack by Osamu Tezuka (Tezuka Productions Company, Limited).
The hindgut of *emc^tink^* homozygous embryos showed LR-asymmetry defects, including LR inversion and LR symmetry (no laterality), at a frequency of about 25% (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A).
The contribution of *emc* to the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut was confirmed by the observation that embryos homozygous for *emc^2^*, a preexisting allele of *emc*, also showed the LR defects of the hindgut (Fig. 2).
In addition, the hindgut of embryos homozygous for *emc^AP6^*, a preexisting null allele of *emc*, and those trans-heterozygous for *emc^tink^* and *emc^AP6^* showed similar LR defects to those of the *emc^tink^* homozygote (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3B, C).
These results suggested that *emc^tink^* is a null mutant of *emc* genetically.
On the other hand, heterozygotes for *emc^AP6^* did not show LR defects, demonstrating that these LR inversion phenotypes were recessive (Fig. 2).
The size of the PCR fragment of *emc* locus amplified from the genomic DNA of *emc^tink^* mutant was smaller than that from wild-type genomic DNA (Fig. 4A).
This data suggests that *emc^tink^* mutants lack partial sequences of the wild-type *emc* locus.
To confirm the deficiency of the *emc* locus in *emc^tink^* mutants, I performed Sanger sequencing of *emc* gene.
*emc^tink^* has a deletion in the coding sequence of the *emc* locus that results in the loss of a C-terminal glutamine-rich region in the deduced Emc protein (Fig. 4 B, C).
Similar Gln-rich repeats are found in many *Drosophila* proteins and are known to have various critical roles (Table 1) [@Grabowski1991; @Rice2015; @Wharton1985], including potentially in the Emc protein [@Garrell1990].
My finding that *emc^tink^* was a null mutant supported the idea that the Gln-rich repeat has an essential role in Emc's function.

To investigate the role of *emc* in LR asymmetric development of the hindgut, I first examined the tissue(s) in which *emc* is required to generate the normal LR-asymmetric morphology of this organ.
First, I examined the *emc* expression in the hindgut of wild-type embryos by *in situ* hybridization during development (Fig. 5).
*emc* was expressed in the hindgut primordium at stage 11 in all of the embryos examined (n = 12) (Fig. 5A and A', Table 2).
The *emc* expression continued in the hindgut at stage 12, when the hindgut started and completed its rotation, in all cases examined (n = 17) (Fig. 5B and B', Table 2).
However, *emc* was only weakly expressed in the hindgut at stage 14 in most of the embryos (14 out of 21), when the hindgut rotation was completed (Fig. 5C, Table 2).
In contrast, a sense probe (negative control) did not exhibit a strong signal from stage 11-14 in wild-type embryos (Fig. 5D, D', E, E', F, and F').
Thus, *emc* was expressed just before and during the rotation of the embryonic hindgut.
Based on this expression pattern, I decided to examine the potential role of *emc* in the tissues of the hindgut.

Our group previously showed that the epithelial cells of the hindgut, but not of the visceral muscles overlying them, are responsible for the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut [@Hozumi2006; @Hozumi2008; @Nakamura2013].
Thus, I misexpressed *UAS-emc::GFP* in the hindgut epithelium of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote using a hindgut epithelium-specific *Gal4* driver line, *NP2432*.
The LR defects associated with *emc^AP6^* were effectively suppressed in these embryos (*NP2432>emc::GFP* in *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3D).
*UAS-emc::GFP* is known to have the wild-type functions of *emc* and to produce the predicted protein size on a Western blot [@Popova2011].
*UAS-emc::GFP* heterozygous embryos did not show the LR defects (Fig. 2).
In *emc^AP6^* homozygotes carrying either *UAS-emc::GFP* or *NP2432* (negative controls), the LR defects were not suppressed (Fig. 2).
The misexpression of *UAS-GFP* driven by *NP2432* also did not suppress the LR defects of *emc^AP6^* (*NP2432*>*GFP* in *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 2).
In addition, neither *UAS-emc::GFP* expression in the visceral muscles of the hindgut, driven by *hand-Gal4*, nor the *emc^AP6^* homozygote carrying only *hand-Gal4* (negative control) suppressed the LR defects of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote (*hand>emc::GFP* in *emc^AP6^* and *hand-Gal4*; *emc^AP6\ ^* in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3E) [@Kuroda2012].
Collectively, these results suggested that a function of *emc* in the embryonic hindgut epithelium is required for normal LR asymmetric development of this organ.
I also found that the misexpression of *UAS-emc::GFP* driven by *NP2432* in wild-type embryos did not lead to LR defects of the embryonic hindgut (Fig. 2), indicating that excess *emc* activity did not affect the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut, even though *emc* was required for this process.

## LR-defects of the *emc* mutant hindgut are not caused by abnormal tissue specification

As described above, *emc* is responsible for the normal LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut, where the endogenous expression of *emc* was detected.
Because it was known that Emc is involved in the differentiation of various tissues, I suspected that the defective specification of the hindgut tissues may cause the LR-defects of its asymmetric development.
The embryonic hindgut is subdivided into four domains, the small intestine, the large intestine, the rectum, and the anal pad (Fig. 6A) [@Hoch1996; @Iwaki2001; @Takashima2001].
The large intestine is further subdivided into three domains, the dorsal and ventral domains and boundary cells (Fig. 6A) [@Fuß2002; @Hoch1996; @Iwaki2001; @Takashima2001].
Various marker genes are available to distinguish these domains in the hindgut.
Therefore, to determine whether these domains were normally specified in *emc* mutants, I examined the expression of these marker genes, *engrailed* (*en*), *crumbs* (*crb*), *hedgehog* (*hh*), and *wingless* (*wg*), which are expressed in the dorsal domain of the large intestine, boundary cells, the rectum, and the anal pad, respectively (Fig. 6A).
The expression patterns detected by the specific antibodies of these genes were similar between the wild-type and *emc^AP6^* mutant embryos (Fig. 6).
These data suggested that the tissue-specification of the hindgut epithelium was largely normal in *emc* homozygous embryos, and the role of *emc* in the cell fate determination of the hindgut tissues was irrelevant to the formation of the normal LR-asymmetry of the embryonic hindgut.

## Suppression of *da* by wild-type *emc* is required for normal LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut

Id proteins, including Emc in *Drosophila*, are known to bind to E proteins and suppress their activity [@Benezra1990; @Ling2014].
Daughterless (Da) is the E protein in *Drosophila*, and its activity has been shown to be suppressed by Emc in various tissues and organs [@Cabrera1991; @Garrell1990; @Murre1989].
Therefore, I speculated that the *da* function might also be suppressed by wild-type *emc* in the hindgut of wild-type embryos (Fig. 7A).
If so, Da should be hyperactivated in the hindgut of *emc* homozygotes, which might lead to the LR defects of this organ (Fig. 7B).
To examine this possibility, I specifically overexpressed *UAS-da* in the hindgut epithelium under control of the *NP2432* line (*NP2432>da* in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9B).
These embryos showed LR asymmetry defects of the hindgut similar to those of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote, suggesting that the LR defects of the hindgut in *emc* homozygotes were caused by a derepression of *da* (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9C).
*NP2432* or *UAS-da* alone did not affect the LR asymmetry of the hindgut (*NP2432-Gal4/+* and *UAS-da/+* in Fig. 3B).
Notably, a *da* null mutant, *da^10^*, also did not show LR defects (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9D), indicating that *da* is not required for the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut, even though its overexpression was sufficient to impede this process.
This result was consistent with my observation that the misexpression of *emc* in the hindgut epithelium of wild-type embryos, in which the *da* activity was presumably suppressed further, did not disrupt the LR asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut (Fig. 2).
Based on these results, I speculated that a hyperactivation of *da* due to the absence of wild-type *emc* results in the LR defects of the hindgut of *emc* mutant embryos.

Given that the hyperactivation of *da* was responsible for the LR defects in *emc* mutants, I speculated that the LR defects associated with the *emc* mutation would be suppressed in a double homozygote with *da*.
In agreement with this scenario, embryos double homozygous for *emc* and *da* did not show the LR defects (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9E).
The expression level of *da* increases in *emc* mutant cells, because the derepression of Da is known to result in auto-activation of the *da* gene through a positive-feedback mechanism (Fig. 7B) [@Bhattacharya2011].
It was difficult to quantify the induction of *da* expression in *emc* mutants by *in situ* hybridization, because the *da* expression was ubiquitous and weak in stage 11-12 embryos.
Therefore, I used quantitative PCR (qPCR) [@VanGuilder2008], which showed that the *da* transcript level in whole embryos homozygous for *emc^AP6^* was 15 times the wild-type level (Fig. 10).
Taking these results together, I concluded that Emc is required for the normal LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut in wild-type *Drosophila*, which is mediated by the inhibition of Da activity (Fig. 7).
