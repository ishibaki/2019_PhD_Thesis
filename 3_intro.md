# Introduction

## Left-right asymmetry in animals

The Bilateria have three body axes: anterior-posterior (AP), dorsal-ventral (DV), and left-right (LR).
The mechanisms by which these three body axes are formed has been a central focus in the field of Developmental Biology [@Arendt1997; @Kimelman2012; @Levin2005].
The mechanisms for AP and DV axis formation are well understood in various bilaterian species [@Arendt1997; @Kimelman2012; @Riechmann2001].
The molecular mechanisms of the LR axis formation have also been well studied, although mostly in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Coutelis2014; @Kimelman2012; @Riechmann2001].
For example, *Nodal*, *Lefty1/2*, and *Pitx2* were identified as the core components of the pathway required for LR axis formation in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Coutelis2014; @Hamada2002; @Hirokawa2006; @Levin2005; @Nakamura2012; @Okumura2008; @Tabin2006].
In some vertebrates, the LR symmetry is first broken by an LR directional flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which is induced by ciliary rotation in the node or its equivalent tissue in early embryos [@Hirokawa2006; @McGrath2003; @Nakamura2012; @Tabin2003; @Yoshiba2014].
In contrast, in invertebrates the mechanisms of LR-asymmetry formation remain largely unclear, although a few excellent studies have unveiled basic concepts behind the directional LR asymmetry formation in nematodes, snails, and *Drosophila* [@Asami2008; @Bergmann2003; @Blum2018; @Coutelis2014; @Kuroda2009; @Naganathan2014; @Okumura2008; @Pohl2010; @Shibazaki2004].
Some invertebrate species develop LR asymmetric body structures using mechanisms arising from the intrinsic chirality of blastomeres or cells in tissues, which is distinct from the mechanism used in vertebrates, indicating that the processes for directional LR symmetric development diverged in evolution [@Blum2018; @Burdine2000; @Coutelis2014; @Nakamura2012; @Okumura2008].
Nevertheless, our group have been studying the mechanisms of LR asymmetry formation in *Drosophila melanogaster*, with the hope of revealing broadly applicable concepts for LR asymmetry formation across the phyla [@Blum2018; @Coutelis2014; @Inaki2016; @Juan2018; @Tingler2018].

Several organs in *Drosophila* show a directional LR asymmetric morphology [@Coutelis2013; @Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006; @Ligoxygakis2001; @Pascual2004; @Petzoldt2012; @Sato2015; @Speder2006].
Among these organs, the embryonic gut is the first to exhibit an LR asymmetric shape during development [@Campos-Ortega2015; @Hayashi2001; @Lengyel2002; @Ligoxygakis2001].
The embryonic gut can be separated into three major portions: the foregut, midgut, and hindgut, each of which exhibits a stereotypic and genetically determined LR-asymmetric morphology [@Campos-Ortega2015].
Among them, the embryonic hindgut shows the simplest morphology, in which a monolayer epithelial tube bends like a hook at its most anterior part (Fig. 1).
At an early stage of embryonic development (stage 12), the hindgut is LR symmetric and bends toward the ventral side of the embryo (Fig. 1A, A’).
At the next stage of development (stage 12-13), the hindgut rotates anticlockwise 90°, which causes the hindgut to curve rightward and to be LR asymmetric (Fig. 1B, B’) [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006].
Neither cell division nor apoptosis is involved in this rotation [@Campos-Ortega2015; @Lengyel2002; @Wells2013].
Moreover, the embryonic hindgut epithelial tube, but not the surrounding visceral muscles, is sufficient for this rotation [@Hozumi2006; @Nakamura2013].
Thus, LR asymmetric cell deformation of the hindgut epithelial cells themselves may contribute to the hindgut rotation.

## Cell chirality

In agreement with this idea, our group previously reported that the epithelial cells of the embryonic hindgut exhibit an LR-asymmetric shape in their apical surface before hindgut rotation [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2016; @Inaki2018; @Taniguchi2011].
Considering that the hindgut epithelial cells also have apical-basal polarity, the three-dimensional structure of these asymmetric hindgut epithelial cells cannot be superimposed onto their mirror image; they therefore fulfill the definition of chirality [@Taniguchi2011].
Thus, our group designated this LR-asymmetric property of the hindgut epithelial cells as "planar cell chirality" [@Taniguchi2011].
After hindgut rotation, the planar cell chirality dissolves, and the epithelial cells become LR symmetric [@Taniguchi2011].
*In silico* models suggested that this dissolution of cell chirality is sufficient to induce the LR asymmetric rotation of the embryonic hindgut [@Inaki2018; @Taniguchi2011].
Our group also demonstrated that the dissolution of cell chirality induces LR-asymmetric cell sliding in the hindgut epithelium, which involves LR-asymmetric changes in the relative positions of cells without their junctional remodeling, and leads to hindgut rotation [@Inaki2018].
Other groups showed that cell chirality is also involved in the LR-asymmetric morphogenesis of the *Drosophila* male genital disc and adult gut [@Petzoldt2012; @Sato2015].

In the *Drosophila* hindgut, cell chirality was found to be an intrinsic property of each individual cell [@Hatori2014].
Consistent with this finding *in vivo*, cell chirality was recently observed in various cultured cells of vertebrates and in blastomeres of *Caenorhabditis elegans* and snails, implying that the cell chirality is a common and intrinsic feature of cells [@Chen2012; @Kuroda2009; @Naganathan2014; @Pohl2010; @Tamada2017; @Tamada2010; @Tee2015; @Wan2011; @Yamanaka2015].
Although Formin is reported to be essential for the formation of cell chirality in mammalian cells and snail blastomeres, the mechanisms underlying cell-chirality formation remain unclear [@Davison2016; @Tee2015].

## Myosin31DF in cell chirality and LR asymmetry

In *Drosophila*, *Myosin31DF* (*Myo31DF*), which encodes a Myosin ID (MyoID) ortholog, has a critical role in switching the enantiomeric states of chiral cells [@Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011].
In *Myo31DF* mutants, the chirality of the hindgut epithelial cells is the mirror image of their wild-type counterparts, and the direction of the hindgut rotation becomes reversed [@Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011].
In addition to the hindgut, *Myo31DF* mutation switches the cell chirality in the male genital disc and adult gut, and consequently reverses the LR asymmetry of these organs as well [@Sato2015; @Speder2006].
*Abdominal-B* (*Abd-B*), a Hox gene, is required to activate *MyoID* expression in the embryonic hindgut and the male genital disc [@Coutelis2013].
In addition, Myo31DF was shown to interact with the adherens junctions and Dachsous (Ds) to regulate the LR asymmetry of the genital disc and adult gut, respectively [@Gonzalez-Morales2015].
These results suggest that Myo31DF functionally and physically interacts with various cellular factors to execute its roles in LR asymmetric development.
However, the molecular functions of Myo31DF in these cases are still elusive.
Notably, MyoID is also reported to have essential roles in LR asymmetric development in vertebrates, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of this overall purpose, although the molecular functions of MyoID may vary [@Tingler2018].

## E and Id proteins

Given that Myo31DF is known to interact functionally and/or physically with various cellular components, including a Hox transcription factor, other classes of transcription factors that globally contribute to embryonic development may also be important for its functions.
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family is one such class of transcription factors [@Massari2000; @Wang2015a].
The bHLH proteins are broadly conserved in various organisms and regulate the transcription of a large number of target genes [@Gyoja2017; @Massari2000; @Morgenstern1999; @Wang2015a].
One class of bHLH proteins, called E proteins, bind to the E-boxes in the *cis*-acting regulatory region of target genes as a homo- or heterodimer, and promote gene transcription [@Massari1999; @Murre1989].
The inhibitor of DNA-binding/differentiation proteins, also known as Id proteins, form a heterodimer with bHLH proteins, including the E proteins, to inhibit their DNA binding [@Benezra1990; @Ling2014].
Therefore, Id proteins act as antagonists of the E proteins [@Benezra1990; @Ling2014], and the balance between E and Id proteins controls various cellular events through the transcriptional regulation of E-protein target genes [@Bhattacharya2011; @Ling2014; @Wang2015a].
For example, the balance between E and Id proteins is reported to be important for cell-cycle regulation [@Wang2015a].
In mammals, E proteins induce the expression of genes encoding CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), which inhibit cell-cycle progression [@Pagliuca2000; @Prabhu1997; @Sloan1996].
Id proteins promote cell-cycle progression, because they prevent the E protein-dependent expression of genes encoding CDKIs [@Lasorella2014].
The E and Id proteins also have important regulatory roles in cell differentiation [@Belle2014; @Murre2005; @Wang2015a].
In general, E proteins promote cell differentiation [@Massari2000; @Wang2015a].
In undifferentiated cells, the level of Id proteins is increased, which inhibits the E-box transcriptional activity of E proteins and consequently maintains the multipotency of the cells [@Lasorella2014; @Nam2009; @Niola2012].
Therefore, for example, mutants of the Id protein-encoding gene in *Drosophila* show ectopic neural differentiation [@Ellis1990; @Garrell1990].

*Drosophila* has single orthologous genes encoding the E and Id proteins, *daughterless* (*da*) and *extra macrochaetae* (*emc*), respectively [@Caudy1988; @Caudy1988a; @Ellis1990; @Garrell1990].
Therefore, the functions of the E and Id proteins are relatively easy to study in *Drosophila*, compared with those in vertebrate systems, which have multiple E and Id proteins [@Gyoja2017].
In *Drosophila*, Da forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with other bHLH proteins to upregulate the expression of target genes, whereas Emc functions as an antagonist of Da by forming an inactive heterodimer with it [@Cabrera1991; @Garrell1990; @Murre1989].
The transcriptional regulations involving Emc and Da control various developmental steps in *Drosophila*, including the spatial organization of neuroblasts, wing development, and follicle cell differentiation [@Bhattacharya2011; @Cummings1994; de Celis et al., 1995; @Ellis1990; @Garrell1990; @Smith2002].
Emc and Da also modulate various cell signaling pathways, such as the Notch pathway, in which their roles have been well studied [@Baonza2000; @Cummings1994].

In this paper, I report for the first time that the interaction between E and Id proteins controls LR-asymmetric development.
I reveal that a mutation of *emc* resulted in the hyperactivation of Da, which subsequently led to LR-asymmetry defects of the embryonic hindgut in *Drosophila*.
These LR defects were coupled with the loss of cell chirality in the hindgut epithelium.
Thus, the suppression of *da* by *emc* was essential for the formation of dextral cell chirality and the LR-asymmetric development of the hindgut, although *da* was not required for these events.
I also report a close relationship between Myo31DF and Emc, and that Myo31DF functioned downstream of or parallel to Emc in LR-asymmetric development and dextral cell chirality formation.
Disorders in the E and Id protein balance are known to lead to various human diseases, which are mostly attributed to defects in cell-fate decision or cell-cycle regulation [@Ling2014; @Wang2015a].
However, here I showed that an aberration in the interaction between E and Id proteins can also affect cell shape.
Therefore, my results may introduce a novel avenue for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of E and Id protein interactions.
