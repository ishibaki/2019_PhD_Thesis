# Result 2: *emc* is required for the cell chirality formation

## The function of Emc-Da may be closely related to that of Myo31DF in the control of hindgut LR asymmetry

In *Myo31DF* mutant *Drosophila* homozygotes, the LR asymmetry of various organs, including the embryonic hindgut, is the mirror image of that in wild type [@Hozumi2006; @Sato2015; @Speder2006].
Considering that both *emc* and *Myo31DF* affect the LR-asymmetry of the embryonic hindgut, I investigated the functional relationship between these two genes with respect to the LR phenotypes of the hindgut.
*Myo31DF^K2^*, a *Myo31DF* null mutant, showed the inversion of hindgut LR asymmetry at 80% frequency (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12B), while, as mentioned above, the *emc^AP6^* homozygote showed LR inversion in the hindgut at about 30% frequency (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12C).
*Myo31DF^K2^; emc^AP6^* double mutants showed the *Myo31DF^K2^* mutant-like phenotype, which was 80% LR inversion (Fig. 11).
This finding suggested that *Myo31DF* is epistatic to *emc* in the control of LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut.

To evaluate this idea further, I examined whether the overexpression of *Myo31DF* rescued the LR defects of the hindgut in *emc* homozygotes.
First, I confirmed that the LR defects of the *Myo31DF^K2^* homozygote were efficiently rescued by the overexpression of *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* in the hindgut epithelium, driven by *NP2432* (*NP2432>Myo31DF::RFP*, *Myo31DF^K2^* in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 D).
*UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* alone (negative control) did not rescue the LR defects of the *Myo31DF^K2^* homozygote (*Myo31DF^K2^*; *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP*/ + in Fig. 11).
However, *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* overexpressed in the hindgut epithelium of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote, driven by *NP2432* (*NP2432>Myo31DF::RFP*, *emc^AP6^*) efficiently rescued the LR defects of the hindgut (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12E).
As described above, the overexpression of *UAS-da* in the hindgut epithelium, driven by *NP2432*, resulted in LR defects in the hindgut of wild-type embryos (*NP2432>da*), suggesting that *da* is hyperactivated in the hindgut epithelium of *emc* mutants, leading to defects in the LR asymmetric development of this organ (Fig. 8, Fig. 9B, Fig. 11, and Fig. 12 F).
The LR defects associated with *da* overexpression were markedly suppressed by the co-overexpression of *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* (*NP2432>da>Myo31DF::RFP*), but not of *UAS-GFP* (negative control, *NP2432>da>GFP*) (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12G).
These observations were consistent with the idea that *Myo31DF* is epistatic to *emc* in the control of the LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut.
Therefore, Myo31DF functions downstream of or parallel to Emc in the LR-asymmetric development of this organ.

Based on the observed epistasis between *Myo31DF* and *emc* mutants and the biochemical function of Emc-Da as a transcription factor, I suspected that *emc* normally induced the *Myo31DF* expression by inactivating Da.
To test this hypothesis, I compared the expression level of the *Myo31DF* gene between wild-type and *emc* mutant embryos.
However, I did not detect a statistically significant difference in the amount of *Myo31DF* mRNA between these two conditions (Fig. 13), suggesting that Emc-Da does not regulate the transcription of the *Myo31DF* gene.
Next, I speculated that the *emc* downstream target gene is responsible for the proper localization of Myo31DF protein.
In this case, the loss of *emc* gene may induce Myo31DF mislocalization, which can cause the LR asymmetric defects of the hindgut.
To test this possibility, I generated *UAS-emc::GFP*-overexpressing clonal cells on the *emc^AP6^* mutant background and stained endogenous Myo31DF with anti-Myo31DF antibody made in our laboratory previously (Fig. 14).
In these cells, I could distinguish *emc-*overexpressing cells from *emc-*mutant cells by staining the Emc::GFP protein with an anti-GFP antibody.
I then compared the expression level and localization of Myo31DF in these two types of cells.
However, I did not find a marked difference in the expression level and localization of Myo31DF between *emc* mutant and *emc*-overexpressing cells (Fig. 14).
These data suggest that the expression level and localization of Myo31DF was not controlled by *emc* or the downstream gene of *emc*.
In addition, since *DE-Cad* and *Myo61F* were also shown to be involved in the LR asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut [@Hozumi2008; @Okumura2015; @Taniguchi2011], I examined the expression level of these genes in the *emc* mutant.
However, again, I did not observe statistically significant differences in the expression of these genes between wild-type and *emc* mutant embryos (Fig. 15 and Fig. 16).
Thus, I have not yet identified the target(s) of Emc-Da that may directly or indirectly interact with the Myo31DF protein in controlling the LR asymmetry of the hindgut.

## Formation of the dextral cell chirality depends on *da* suppression by *emc*

Our group previously demonstrated that chiral cell deformation drives the anticlockwise rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube [@Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011].
In the wild-type hindgut, before its rotation (at stage 12), hindgut epithelial cells show cell chirality, in which their apical cell boundaries tend to tilt leftwards (Fig. 17A) [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2018a; @Taniguchi2011].
Subsequent cancellation of this cell chirality leads to the hindgut rotation (Fig. 17B) [@Taniguchi2011].
Our group also previously showed that this cell chirality does not form properly in mutants that show LR defects in their embryonic hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
Therefore, I suspected that the cell chirality does not form normally in *emc* mutants, leading to the LR defects of this organ.
To quantify the cell chirality, I obtained confocal microscopic images that showed the focal plane corresponding the apical region of the hindgut epithelial cells, detected by anti-DE-Cad antibody staining, as described previously (Fig. 18A) [@Taniguchi2011].
I then calculated the angle $\theta$ between the apical cell boundaries and the anterior-posterior axis of the hindgut, and computed the chirality index for each embryo using the following formula: chirality index = $(N_{R} - N_{L})/(N_{R} + N_{L})$ (Fig. 18B).
In this formula, N_{R} and N_{L} represent the numbers of boundaries with $\theta$ values from 0 to 90° and from -90 to 0°, respectively (Fig. 18B).
In this analysis, the chirality index is less than 0 if the apical cell boundaries tend to tilt to the left side of the hindgut AP axis (Fig. 18B).
Note that the distribution of chirality index was closely approximated by a normal distribution not by a bimodal distribution even if the cell chirality is not normally distributed, because of the central limit theorem [@Fischer2011].
The apical cell boundaries tilted leftward in the wild-type hindgut, for which the mean chirality index was -0.11 ± 0.03 (dextral chirality) (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20A).
In contrast, in the hindgut of the *Myo31DF^K2^* homozygote, the cell chirality was the mirror image (sinistral) of that in wild type, with a chirality index of 0.13 ± 0.03 (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20B).
These results recapitulated our previous findings that wild-type and *Myo31DF* mutant cells show dextral and sinistral states of cell chirality, respectively [@Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011].

Next, I measured the cell chirality of the hindgut cells in the *emc^AP6^* mutant.
In the *emc^AP6^* homozygote the mean chirality index was nearly 0, indicating that the cell chirality disappeared, and that the shape of the apical cell boundaries was LR symmetric in the hindgut epithelium on average (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20C).
To examine whether *emc* was necessary to generate the dextral cell chirality in the hindgut epithelium, I specifically overexpressed *emc::GFP*, driven by *NP2432*, in this tissue in the *emc^AP6^* homozygote.
The cell chirality was significantly restored in these embryos (*p* < 0.01; *NP2432>emc::GFP* in *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20D).
Thus, I concluded that *emc* is required for the formation of dextral cell chirality in this tissue, which is responsible for the LR-asymmetric development of the hindgut.
Consistent with my finding that *da* overexpression resulted in LR embryonic-hindgut defects similar to those of *emc* mutants (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9B), I also found that the cell chirality was abolished by *NP2432-*driven *da* overexpression in the hindgut epithelium, in which the chirality index was 0.04 ± 0.02 (*p* < 0.01; *NP2432>da* in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20E).

Since the LR defects of the embryonic hindgut associated with *emc* mutation were effectively restored by overexpressing *Myo31DF* in the hindgut epithelium (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12B, D), I speculated that the loss of cell chirality in the hindgut epithelium of *emc* mutants could be also restored by *Myo31DF* overexpression in this tissue.
I first confirmed that the tissue-specific overexpression of *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* in the hindgut epithelium, driven by *NP2432*, changed the cell chirality from sinistral to dextral (chirality index: -0.06 ± 0.02) in the *Myo31DF^K2^* mutant (*NP2432>Myo31DF::RFP* in *Myo31DF^K2^* in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20F) [@Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011].
I then similarly overexpressed *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* in the *emc^AP6^* homozygote, and found that the loss of cell chirality associated with the *emc^AP6^* mutation was also significantly restored to the dextral state in these embryos, in which the cell chirality index changed from 0.01 ± 0.02 to -0.14 ± 0.04 (compare *NP2342>Myo31DF::RFP* in *emc^AP6^* and *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20C, G).
In the *emc* mutants, I ascertained that hyperactivated *da* causes LR asymmetric defects of the embryonic hindgut (Fig. 7).
I therefore examined whether the cell chirality defects in the *emc* mutants could be rescued in the absence of *da* function.
*da^10^; emc^AP6^* double homozygous embryos showed the wild-type (dextral) cell chirality in the hindgut epithelial cells (chirality index: - 0.11 ± 0.02; Fig. 19).
This data implicates that the regulation of Da by Emc is required for the normal cell chirality formation.
If Da intermediates the cell chirality formation by Emc, the cell chirality defects in the *da*-overexpressing embryos could be rescued by co-overexpressing *Myo31DF* in the hindgut epithelium.
Therefore, I quantified the chirality index in the embryos co-overexpressing *da* and *Myo31DF*.
In the these embryos, the cell chirality was restored from the achiral to the dextral state in this tissue (chirality index: -0.12 ± 0.02; *NP2342>da> Myo31DF::RFP* in Fig. 19 and Fig 20H).
Taking these results together, I speculated that Myo31DF functions downstream of or parallel to the regulatory pathway of Emc and Da for the cell chirality formation and LR asymmetric development of the hindgut (Fig 21).

## Cell chirality sigmoidally correlates with the hindgut laterality

Previously, our group suggested that dissolution of cell chirality induces the rotation of the hindgut [@Inaki2018a; @Taniguchi2011].
However, it was not studied well how much the cell chirality contributes to the determination of the torsion direction of the hindgut.
To evaluate the potential contribution of the cell chirality to the formation of the wild-type LR asymmetry, I analyzed the correlation coefficient between these two properties.
I analyzed the relationships between the cell chirality and the probability of the wild-type rotational direction in the hindgut (Fig. 22).
The proportion of hindguts demonstrating normal LR asymmetry that was calculated in Fig. 2, Fig. 8, and Fig. 11 showed a strong negative correlation with the chirality index that was calculated in Fig. 19 (R = - 0.926), suggesting that dextral cell chirality tends to induce the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut (Fig. 22).
These observations further suggested that the cell chirality controlled through Emc-Da and Myo31DF is responsible for the LR asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut.

Although the cell chirality showed the strong correlation coefficient with the frequency where the hindgut showed the wild-type LR asymmetry, it was possible that the cell chirality non-linearly correlates with the hindgut LR-asymmetry.
To understand the relationship between these two factors further, I elucidated another model that gives a better coefficient of determination (R^2^).
When I fitted the data by using a linear function $/alpha /cdot x + \beta$, the coefficient of determination was 0.858 (Fig. 22, and Table 3).
On the other hand, the fitting by Hill equation $1 - \frac{(x + \alpha)^{n}}{\beta + (x + \alpha)^{n}}$ gave the coefficient of determination as 0.982 (Fig. 22, and Table 3) [@Hill1910].
This result means that the Hill equation gives a better explanation for the relationships between in the cell chirality and the LR laterality of the hindgut.

To further evaluate the contribution of the cell chirality to the LR asymmetric rotation, I performed live imaging and elucidated whether cell chirality in the living hindgut relates to the actual direction of the rotation.
I obtained the apical cell images of the hindgut before rotation and continued culturing the embryo.
After I cultured the embryo for 3 hours, I evaluated the LR laterality of the hindgut.
Because wild-type embryos do not show the inverse or non-lateral phenotype of the hindgut, I observed *emc^AP6^* embryos overexpressing *UAS-myristoylated GFP* (*UAS-myrGFP*) driven by *byn-Gal4*, a hindgut epithelium-specific driver.
I calculated the chirality index of the living embryos (live chirality index) as described above and analyzed the relationship between the live chirality index and the LR laterality of the hindgut in *emc^AP6^* mutant embryos.
I evaluated the normal, non-lateral, and inverse laterality as 1, 0.5, and 0, respectively (Fig. 23).
Also in this analysis, the live chirality index showed a strong negative correlation with the LR asymmetry of the hindgut (R = - 0.891) (Fig. 23).
I also fitted my data by using Hill equation and compared a Hill equation model and a linear fitting model [@Hill1910].
The coefficient of determination given by the fitted Hill equation were 0.872 and they were lower than those of the fitted linear model (coefficient of determination of the linear model: 0.794) (Fig. 23, and Table 3).
This result indicated that the cell chirality in the living cells also show sigmoidal correlation to the rotational direction of the hindgut.
These results suggested that the direction of the hindgut rotation is determined stochastically following a distribution approximated by Hill equation.
Importantly, in the Hill equation, larger $n$ represents larger cooperativity of $x$ to $y$ [@Hill1910].
These data implied that the cell chirality cooperatively determines the rotational direction of the hindgut.

## The apical cell surface of the hindgut epithelium expands in *emc* mutants, which is irrelevant to the cell chirality formation 

My analysis of the apical cell boundaries in the hindgut epithelium also revealed that the apical surface of these cells expanded in embryos homozygous for *emc* mutations.
Using the same images of the apical cell boundaries in the hindgut epithelium before hindgut rotation (stage 12) that were used for the cell-chirality analysis (as in Fig. 19A), I measured the area of the apical surface of individual hindgut epithelial cells.
The area of the apical cell surface in the *emc^AP6^* mutant (7.01±0.33 μm^2^) was about twice that of wild-type (2.85±0.29 μm^2^) (Fig. 20A, C, and Fig. 24).
This expansion of the apical surface in the *emc^AP6^* mutant was fully suppressed by the tissue-specific overexpression of *UAS-emc::GFP* in the hindgut epithelium driven by *NP2432* (2.67 ± 0.23 μm^2^), suggesting that the lack of *emc* functions in these cells was responsible for the apical expansion (*NP2342>emc::GFP* in *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 20D and Fig. 24).
However, in contrast to my observation that the cell chirality was abolished in the *UAS-da*-overexpressing wild-type hindgut epithelium, the same overexpression of *UAS-da* did not change the area of the apical surface (*NP2342>da* in Fig. 20E and Fig. 24).
Therefore, I speculated that *da* is not involved in the apical expansion, unlike the cell chirality formation, of these cells in the *emc* mutant.
To confirm this hypothesis, I quantified the apical size of the hindgut cells in *da^10^; emc^AP6^* double homozygous embryos.
The apical area remained larger in *da^10^; emc^AP6^* double mutants (2.67 ± 0.23 μm^2^; Fig. 24).
These results collectively suggested that Emc has multiple actions in the hindgut epithelium, and that while the cell chirality is probably controlled through Da, the size of the apical surface is controlled through a bHLH protein(s) other than Da (Fig. 21).
This idea is consistent with the ability of Id protein to form heterodimers with various bHLH proteins [@Benezra1990; @Ling2014].

Considering that the overexpression of *da* abolished the cell chirality but did not induce expansion of the apical surface in the hindgut epithelial cells, I speculated that the apical expansion and the disruption of cell chirality in these cells were independent events.
To test this possibility further, I examined whether the recovery of cell chirality in the hindgut epithelial cells of *emc* mutants by the overexpression of *Myo31DF* was coupled with a suppression of apical expansion in these cells.
I specifically overexpressed *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* in the hindgut epithelium of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote, driven by *NP2432* and found that the size of the apical surface was slightly rescued (from 7.01±0.33 μm^2^ in the *emc^AP6^* homozygote to 5.48 ±0.30 μm^2^), but it was still significantly larger than that of wild-type (*p* < 0.001; 2.85±0.29 μm^2^) (*NP2432>Myo31DF::RFP* in *emc^AP6^* in Fig. 20G and Fig. 24).
The same overexpression of *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* in the hindgut epithelium of the *emc^AP6^* homozygote efficiently rescued the LR defects of the embryonic hindgut associated with the *emc^AP6^* mutation, as mentioned above (Fig. 11 and Fig 12E).
Based on these analysis, I speculated that the size of the apical surface does not affect the cell chirality formation or the LR asymmetric rotation of the embryonic hindgut, which is driven by the dissolution of the cell chirality [@Taniguchi2011].
Furthermore, although the loss of cell chirality in the *UAS-da*-overexpressing hindgut epithelium was thoroughly restored by the co-overexpression of *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* (Fig. 19), the size of the apical surface was normal in the hindgut epithelium overexpressing *UAS-da* alone (3.83 ± 0.35 μm^2^) or co-overexpressing *UAS-da* and *UAS-Myo31DF::RFP* (3.98 ± 0.44 μm^2^) (*NP2432>da* and *NP2432>da>Myo31DF::RFP* in Fig. 24 and Fig. 20E, G).
I also found that the area of the apical surface was normal in the hindgut epithelium of the *Myo31DF^K2^* homozygote (2.89 ± 0.16 μm^2^) (Fig. 20B and Fig. 24).
Thus, I concluded that the expansion of the apical surface of the hindgut epithelium in *emc* mutants was irrelevant to the disruption of cell chirality formation and of the LR asymmetric rotation of the embryonic hindgut (Fig 21).

It was also reported that cortical F-actin drives the apical constriction of epithelial cells in various species [@Heisenberg2013; @Inoue2016; @Lecuit2007].
Thus, I speculated that the cortical localization of F-actin is disrupted in *emc* mutants, which induces the apical expansion of the hindgut epithelial cells.
To examine this possibility, I generated *UAS-emc::GFP*-overexpressing clonal cells on the *emc^AP6^* mutant background, and stained the F-actin with a fluorescent phalloidin (Fig. 25).
I compared the level of F-actin at the apical, lateral and basal regions of the hindgut epithelial cells.
However, I did not find a marked difference in the level of phalloidin signal between these two types of cells (Fig. 23), suggesting that F-actin was not involved in the apical cell expansion caused by the lack of *emc* gene function.

## The number of the hindgut epithelial cells is not changed in *emc* mutants

Our group previously reported that the reduction of cell number in the hindgut epithelium disrupts the LR asymmetry of the hindgut [@Maeda2007; @Nakamura2013].
In *pebble* (*pbl*) and *string* (*stg*) mutants, the proper cell proliferation was not underwent, which inhibits the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut [@Nakamura2013].
We also suggested that the properly regulated cell number in the anal pad by *single-minded* (*sim*) might contribute to the LR asymmetry of the embryonic hindgut [@Maeda2007].
Because it was known that *emc* is involved in the cell proliferation [@Benezra1990; @Lasorella2014; @Wang2015b], I suspected that the disruption of the cell number regulation induced the disruption of the cell chirality and the LR asymmetry of the hindgut in *emc* mutants.
To confirm this hypothesis, I stained the nuclei with anti-Lamin C antibody, and counted the number of Lamin C positive nuclei in the hindgut.
Previously, it was reported that Lamin C expression is only detected in the hindgut during the *Drosophila* embryogenesis [@Riemer1995], thus the number of Lamin C positive nuclei reflect the number of the hindgut cells (Fig. 26A, B).
I compared the number of the hindgut cells between wild-type and *emc* mutant and found that the cell number was almost same (p = 0.717; wild-type: 687 ± 7, *emc*: 694 ± 15; Fig. 26C).
This data suggests that *emc* is not required for the regulation of the cell number in the hindgut and that the defects in the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut observed in *emc* mutant is not due to the dysregulation of the cell proliferation.
Although I examined the cell properties such as the cell-type specification, apical cell size, number, and cell chirality of hindgut epithelial cells, only the phenotypes of the cell chirality correlate to those the hindgut LR asymmetry.
Based on these results, I concluded that Emc-Da regulates cell chirality formation, in which Emc functions upstream of or parallel to Myo31DF, and the proper chirality is involved in the normal LR asymmetric rotation of the hindgut.
