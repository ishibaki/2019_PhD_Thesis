## *da* needs to be suppressed by *emc* for the proper development of LR-asymmetry of the embryonic hindgut

The regulatory network composed of E and Id proteins is known to control a large number of cell-fate decisions, from *Drosophila* to humans [@Ling2014; @Massari2000; @Wang2015a].
In this study, I extended our understanding of this regulatory network by revealing that the suppression of an E protein Da by an Id homolog Emc is required for normal epithelial morphogenesis, in the LR asymmetric rotation of the hindgut tube in *Drosophila*.
Emc forms inactive heterodimers with various bHLH proteins, including Da, a ubiquitous partner, and tissue-specific bHLH proteins, such as proneural bHLH proteins [@Ellis1990].
I here identified *emc^tink^* as a novel null allele of *emc* that disrupts the LR asymmetry of the embryonic hindgut (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).
The deduced product of *emc^tink^* lacks a Gln-rich region located at the C-terminus.
This Gln-rich region is conserved in various bHLH proteins, including Hairy, in which it appears to be important for regulating the protein’s degradation [@Wainwright1992].
My present results suggest that the Gln-rich region in Id also has an essential role in its suppression of Da (Fig. 4).

The LR defects of the hindgut associated with a null mutant of *emc* were completely suppressed when combined with a *da* mutation (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9E), indicating that they could be completely attributed to the hyperactivation of *da*.
Consistent with this role of *emc* and *da* in the embryonic hindgut, I also found that *emc* was expressed in the embryonic hindgut before and during hindgut rotation (Fig. 5); the ubiquitous expression of *da* during embryogenesis was previously reported [@Vaessin1994].

Although the hyperactivation of *da* was responsible for the LR defects of the hindgut in the *emc* mutant (Fig 8 and Fig. 9B), I also found that *da* was dispensable for the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9D).
The hyperactivation of *da* was harmful to this process, indicating that *da*’s function needs to be suppressed by the wild-type *emc* to achieve the normal LR asymmetric development.
Da is known to regulate the transcription of many target genes [@Wang2015a].
For example, the expression of *expanded* (*ex*) is positively regulated through the binding of Da to the regulatory region of the *ex* gene [@Wang2015b].
However, in the present study I was unable to identify the target gene(s) of Da responsible for the LR-asymmetric development of the embryonic gut.
Previously identified genes that are involved in the LR asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut include *DE-Cad* and *Myo31DF* [@Taniguchi2011].
However, I was unable to detect alterations in the expression of these genes in *emc* mutant embryos (Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15 and Fig. 16).
To identify the genes responsible for inducing the LR defects in *emc* mutants, I am currently analyzing alterations in the expression level of genes in the *da*-overexpressing hindgut using an RNA-seq approach.

## The Emc-Da cascade is essential for the formation of dextral cell chirality

Our group previously demonstrated that the dissolution of cell chirality in the hindgut epithelial cells is responsible for the LR-directional rotation of this organ [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2016; @Inaki2018; @Taniguchi2011].
In agreement with this process, I here found that cell chirality was not observed in the hindgut epithelium of the *emc* mutant (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20C).
I also found a lack of cell chirality in *da*-overexpressing hindgut epithelial cells, consistent with my idea that the hyperactivation of *da* in the hindgut epithelial cells causes the LR defects in the *emc* mutant (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20E).
Therefore, I speculate that at least a downstream target gene of Da is involved in the formation of cell chirality, although such target genes currently remain unknown.
However, importantly, I revealed that the overexpression of *Myo31DF* in the hindgut epithelial cells of *emc* mutant embryos restored both their cell chirality and the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut (Fig. 11, Fig. 12E, Fig. 19, and Fig. 20G).
Thus, the crucial defects responsible for the failure in cell chirality formation associated with the loss of *emc* function or the hyperactivation of *da* in these epithelial cells could be compensated for by an excess amount of Myo31DF.
Similarly, the LR defects of the hindgut and male genitalia in an *Abd-B* *Drosophila* mutant, in which the default state of LR asymmetry is disrupted, are restored by overexpressing *Myo31DF* [@Coutelis2013].
In addition, my analysis of genetic epistasis between *emc* and *Myo31DF* in the cell chirality formation and LR asymmetric development of the hindgut revealed that Myo31DF functions downstream of or parallel to Emc.
Thus, the target gene(s) of Da encodes a protein that presumably has a close relationship with Myo31DF biochemically, although this part of the pathway remains unknown at this point.

## Cell chirality may cooperatively determine the rotational direction of the hindgut

Our group previously suggested that the dissolution of the cell chirality generates mechanical force, which induced the rotation of the hindgut [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2018; @Taniguchi2011].
According to this hypothesis, an embryo showing the inverse cell chirality to wild-type will show the inverse LR laterality of the hindgut to the wild-type embryos' hindgut.
In fact, in *Myo31DF*mutants, the cell chirality is inverse to the wild-type, and the hindgut rotates to the direction inverse to the wild-type (Fig. 22) [@Hozumi2006; @Taniguchi2011].
This hypothesis predicts that the hindgut in which the cell chirality disappears cannot rotate to both directions or weakly rotate to either side.
However, despite the chirality index was nearly 0, about 70% and 20% of the *emc* mutant embryos completely rotated the hindgut to the wild-type direction and the inverse direction, respectively (Fig. 2, 19A, and 20C).
Based on these results, I supposed that the rotational state of the hindgut is energetically bistable where the unrotated hindgut is relatively unstable compared with the rotated hindgut (Fig. 27).
This hypothesis implies that the hindgut where the cell chirality disappears is unstable and small perturbations in individual embryos determine the rotational direction in *emc* mutants (Fig. 27A, B’).
On the other hand, because wild-type cells have the enough cell chirality to determine the rotational direction, major portion of the hindgut in wild-type embryos might rotate to the wild-type direction (Fig. 27A, B).

This bi-state transition can be observed in a cooperative system such as kinetics of allosteric enzymes [@Monod1965].
For example, it was well known that hemoglobin-oxygen binding enhances the binding ability of hemoglobin, which is required for the transition between high affinity state and low affinity state of hemoglobin [@Royer2001].
I supposed that such a cooperative translating system functions in the hindgut to determine the LR asymmetry, because cooperativity was observed in the relationship between the cell chirality and the rotational direction of the hindgut (Fig. 22 and 23).
In wild-type or *Myo31DF*, major cells have cell chirality, which provides stable determination of the rotational direction of the hindgut.
On the other hand, *emc* mutants lost the cell chirality of the hindgut cells on average, which is in a boundary condition to determine the rotational direction.
In the boundary condition, small fluctuation of cell chirality in individual embryos may stochastically determine the laterality of the hindgut.
At this point, I could not identify the molecular entities or genes involved in this cooperative translating system.
To reveal the molecular basis of the translating system of cell chirality must be important to understand how the LR asymmetric laterality is determined in *Drosophila*.

## *emc* controls the size of the apical cell surface independently of *da*

I here found that wild-type *emc* reduced the area of the apical cell surface of the hindgut epithelial cells at stage 12, given that this area was significantly increased in *emc* mutant embryos, and this increase was efficiently suppressed by the overexpression of *emc* in the hindgut epithelium of these embryos (Fig. 20A, C, D, and Fig 24).
In contrast, the overexpression of *da* in the hindgut epithelium did not affect the size of the apical cell surface (Fig. 20E, and Fig 24).
This result was unexpected, since both the *emc* mutant embryos and *da*-overexpressing embryos showed similar defects in cell chirality formation and LR asymmetric development of the hindgut.
Therefore, the expansion of the apical cell surface was not required for the LR defects in the embryonic hindgut or the loss of cell chirality formation.
In addition, these results demonstrated that the wild-type *emc* gene controlled the size of the apical surface independently of *da* gene functions.
This idea was consistent with the previous findings that Emc forms heterodimers with various bHLH proteins to suppress their transcription activities [@Cabrera1991; @Garrell1990; @Murre1989].
Various factors controlling the size of the apical surface have been identified [@Heisenberg2013; @Inoue2016; @Lecuit2007].
For example, the regulation of cortical F-actin is involved in the apical constriction of epithelial cells [@Heisenberg2013; @Inoue2016; @Lecuit2007].
However, in the hindgut epithelium of *emc* mutant cells, I did not observe a marked alteration in the amount or distribution of the cortical F-actin (Fig. 25).
Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of the apical expansion are unknown at this point.

As discussed above, the tissue-specific overexpression of *Myo31DF* in the hindgut epithelium rescued the disappearance of cell chirality found in the epithelial cells of the *emc* mutant hindgut.
In contrast, the same overexpression of *Myo31DF* did not completely rescue the increase in the apical size of these cells, although *Myo31DF* overexpression slightly reduced it (Fig. 20B, F, and Fig. 24).
These results imply that the restoration of dextral cell chirality by *Myo31DF* overexpression was independent of the apical expansion under the *emc* mutant condition.
Although the expansion of the apical surface may influence the mechanical conditions of the hindgut epithelium, my results showed that the formation of cell chirality was not affected by it.
In addition, the dextral rotation of the hindgut was little affected by the apical expansion.
Therefore, the potential mechanical changes due to apical expansion did not obstruct the LR directional rotation of the hindgut.

## Implication for the roles of cascades involving Id and E proteins in human diseases

*E* and *Id* genes are reported to be involved in development and morphogenesis by controlling cell proliferation and cell differentiation [@Benezra1990; @Ling2014; @Massari2000; @Wang2015a].
For example, mutant mice of *TCF4*, which encodes the E2-2 protein, show defects in the hindbrain development, and *Id1* and *Id3* mutant mice show cranial bone deformation and vascular malformations in the brain [@Flora2007; @Lyden1999; @Maeda2004].
In *Drosophila*, a mosaic analysis in the imaginal discs revealed that *emc* mutation leads to abnormal tissue-specifications in the adult wings, legs, halteres, and notum [@Alonso1988; @DeCelis1995].
In addition, dysregulations of E-Id cascades are responsible for various human diseases [@Benezra1990; @Lasorella2014; @Ling2014; @Wang2015a].
For example, *TCF4* is a causal gene of schizophrenia or Pitt-Hopkins syndrome in humans [@Zweier2007].
An E-Id cascade is also disrupted in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients, implying that human bHLH is associated with bone marrow development [@Zhang1997].
Thus, our current understanding of the pathology of human diseases associated with aberrations of the E-Id cascade has been mostly restricted to defects in cell-fate decisions including the control of cell death and cell proliferation [@Lasorella2014; @Massari2000; @Wang2015a].
In contrast, in this study, I revealed that the E-Id cascade also regulates specific properties of cell shape.
The suppression of an E protein (Da) by Id (Emc) was essential for the formation of dextral cell chirality, and the Id protein was also required for apical constriction (Fig. 21).
Therefore, my results indicate that cell-shape change, which may drive tissue deformation, should also be considered a possible outcome of the defects in E-Id cascades (Fig. 28).
Local cell shape plays an important role in organ morphogenesis [@Heisenberg2013; @Inoue2016; @Lecuit2007; @Leptin2005].
Thus, my results suggest that disorders in tissue and organ structure should be considered as potential pathologies in diseases associated with defective E-Id cascades.
